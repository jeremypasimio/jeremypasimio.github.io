Unofficial video hub for training videos for the United Fighting Arts Federation

Simple video hub for easy access to training videos for Chuck Norris' United Fighting Arts Federation. The goal is to have the training videos be easy to watch from a mobile device while training.

TODO
1. Rebuild from scratch as a React or React Native project.
2. Move video source from embedded youtube to CDN.
3. Once CDN is integrated, expand capability to allow for user video upload.
